# üì± Mobile Access Troubleshooting Guide

## Quick Fix Checklist

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Verify Server is Running
```bash
npm run dev
```
You should see: `Local: http://localhost:5173/` and `Network: http://[IP]:5173/`

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Find Your Computer's IP Address

**Windows:**
```bash
ipconfig
```
Look for "IPv4 Address" under your WiFi adapter (e.g., 192.168.1.100)

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
ifconfig | grep "inet "
```
or
```bash
ip addr show
```
Look for an IP like 192.168.x.x or 10.0.x.x

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Check Same WiFi Network
- **CRITICAL**: Your phone and laptop MUST be on the SAME WiFi network
- Don't use mobile data on your phone
- Check WiFi name matches on both devices

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Access from Phone
Open browser on phone and go to:
```
http://[YOUR_PC_IP]:5173
```
Example: `http://192.168.1.100:5173`

## üî• Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Connection Refused / Can't Connect

**Solution A: Windows Firewall**
1. Open "Windows Defender Firewall"
2. Click "Allow an app through firewall"
3. Click "Change settings" ‚Üí "Allow another app"
4. Browse to Node.js or add port 5173
5. Check both Private and Public networks

**Solution B: Create Firewall Rule (Windows)**
```bash
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Vite Dev Server" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=5173
```

**Solution C: Mac Firewall**
System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Firewall ‚Üí Firewall Options ‚Üí Add Node

**Solution D: Temporarily Disable Firewall (Testing Only)**
- Windows: Turn off Windows Defender Firewall temporarily
- Mac: System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Firewall ‚Üí Turn Off

### Issue 2: Wrong IP Address
- Don't use 127.0.0.1 or localhost
- Use your actual local network IP (192.168.x.x or 10.0.x.x)
- Vite should show the Network URL when starting

### Issue 3: VPN or Multiple Networks
- Disable VPN on both devices
- Make sure laptop isn't using Ethernet while phone uses WiFi
- Both must be on the same network segment

### Issue 4: Router Isolation (Guest Network)
- Some routers isolate devices on guest networks
- Move both devices to main WiFi network
- Check router settings for "AP Isolation" and disable it

## üß™ Testing Steps

1. **Restart dev server** after config changes:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check Vite output** - should show:
   ```
   ‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
   ‚ûú  Network: http://192.168.1.100:5173/
   ```

3. **Test from laptop first**:
   - Open `http://[YOUR_IP]:5173` in laptop browser
   - If this doesn't work, firewall is blocking

4. **Then test from phone**:
   - Use the exact Network URL shown by Vite
   - Try both Chrome and Safari on phone

## üÜò Still Not Working?

### Advanced Debugging

**Check if port is listening:**
```bash
# Windows
netstat -an | findstr :5173

# Mac/Linux
lsof -i :5173
```

**Ping test from phone:**
- Download a network utility app
- Ping your PC's IP address
- If ping fails, network issue exists

**Try different port:**
Edit `vite.config.ts` and change port to 3000 or 8080

**Check antivirus software:**
- Temporarily disable antivirus
- Add exception for Node.js or port 5173

## ‚ú® Success Indicators

When working correctly:
- ‚úÖ Vite shows Network URL on startup
- ‚úÖ Can access from laptop using IP:5173
- ‚úÖ Can access from phone using same URL
- ‚úÖ App loads and functions normally

---

## üìù Configuration Reference

Your `vite.config.ts` should have:
```typescript
server: {
  host: "0.0.0.0",  // Allows external connections
  port: 5173,       // Standard Vite port
}
```

**After ANY config changes, restart the dev server!**
